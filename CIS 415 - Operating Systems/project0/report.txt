Implemented using a hashset.

I was not helped by any classmates, but in 212 we did this same assignment
as an extra credit and I referenced that code for writing this
assignment.

	5 - Success, 0 bytes in use on exit.
	6 - Success, 0 bytes in use on exit.
	7 - Success, 0 bytes in use on exit.
	8 - Success, 0 bytes in use on exit.
	9 - Success, 0 bytes in use on exit.
	10 - Success, 0 bytes in use on exit.
	11 - Success, 0 bytes in use on exit.
	12 - Success, 0 bytes in use on exit.
	13 - Success, 0 bytes in use on exit.
	14 - Success, 0 bytes in use on exit.
	15 - Success, 0 bytes in use on exit.
	16 - Success, 0 bytes in use on exit.
	17 - Success, 0 bytes in use on exit.

Current state of submission - Stringtest:
	1 - Success, 0 bytes in use on exit.
	2 - Success, 0 bytes in use on exit.
	3 - Success, 0 bytes in use on exit.
	4 - Success, 0 bytes in use on exit.
	5 - Success, 0 bytes in use on exit.
	6 - Success, 0 bytes in use on exit.
	7 - Success, 0 bytes in use on exit.
	8 - Success, 0 bytes in use on exit.
	9 - Success, 0 bytes in use on exit.
	10 - Success, 0 bytes in use on exit.
	11 - Success, 0 bytes in use on exit.
	12 - Success, 0 bytes in use on exit.
	13 - Success, 0 bytes in use on exit.
	14 - Success, 0 bytes in use on exit.
	15 - Success, 0 bytes in use on exit.
	16 - Success, 0 bytes in use on exit.
	17 - Success, 0 bytes in use on exit.

As you can see above, I was able to pass every test.
