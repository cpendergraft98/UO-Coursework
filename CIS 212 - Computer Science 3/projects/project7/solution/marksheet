* I don't know how you managed to get things to work having both of these in
  your main()
  const Queue *q = Queue_create(NULL);
  q = LListQueue(NULL);
  This should have led to an error from the linker, since Queue_create may
  have been matched in arrayqueue.o in the library, and when you invoked
  LListQueue(), that would have been matched by llistqueue.o in the library,
  which also contains code for Queue_create(). I commented out the 2nd line
  above, and the log shows the results of executing that exerciseQueue.
* too bad that you did not eliminate the compiler warnings on llistqueue.c
