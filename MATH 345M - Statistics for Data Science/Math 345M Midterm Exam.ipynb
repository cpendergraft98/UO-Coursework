Qualitative data, on the other hand, cannot be counted in this same way; qualitative data is often expressed using words. Continuous because we can continually subdivide our data and it still makes sense. I.e. it is totally acceptable to say \"I read 3.256 books this month\"- we can read a fractional amount of books, and though .256 of a book might amount to reading the title and the first page, it still makes sense to claim that we read a 0.256 of book. Discrete data does not work this way, if we were counting how many people read 3 books in 1 month, it would make no sense to say \"1 and 2/3 person read 3 books in one month\", as there is no such thing as 2/3 of a human."

Thus, finding the probability that we have an 11.1% chance of choosing 2 blue chips is the same as finding the probability of the probability of choosing Box B and then two blue chips, which is just the probability that the two blue chips we drew were from box B.
