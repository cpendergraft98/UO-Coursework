CIS 211 Major Project- Bitfield

AUTHOR: Cole Pendergraft

A bit field is a range of binary digits within an
unsigned integer.   Bit 0 is the low-order bit,
with value 1 = 2^0.  Bit 31 is the high-order bit,
with value 2^31.

A bitfield object is an aid to encoding and decoding
instructions by packing and unpacking parts of the
instruction in different fields within individual
instruction words.
