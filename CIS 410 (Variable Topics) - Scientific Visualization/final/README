I had some pretty interesting behavior with my render when I tried to start upping the number of samples I took along my ray. I found that as the sample size got closer to one of my two dimensions the image would become more unstable and drift further from the expected output. Meaning, taking 256 samples of a 500x500 image produces something really close to the expected output, but 500x500 at 512 is off-colored, and 500x500 at 1024 samples is insane looking. I was unable to figure out how to prevent this before running out of time, unfortunately, the 500x500 image with 1024 samples that we were supposed to use for our final image is way thrown off for me, I'm not sure why but the image is completely messed. I was still able to generate images that looked like the expected output using a pixel densisty of 500x500 and taking 256 samples. I got somewhat close with a 1000x1000 image at 512 samples, but the color was thrown off like it was with 500x500 at 512 samples. My runs with various pixel densities and sample sizes usually resulted in one of three similar images being produced, each of which are demonstrated here. Either the one closest to the intended output (500x500 with 256 samples), one with the coloring thrown off (1000x1000 with 512 samples), or just catastrophically incorrect (500x500 with 1024 samples).
